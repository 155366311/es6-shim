# ES6 Shim
Provides compatibility shims so that legacy JavaScript engines behave as
closely as possible to ECMAScript 6 (Harmony).

Project targets engines that support ES5 (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera). With
[ES5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim) it could also work in older
browsers.

## Installation

    npm install es6-shim

## Safe shims
* Maps & Sets
* String.prototype.repeat, String.prototype.startsWith,
String.prototype.endsWith, String.prototype.contains, String.prototype.toArray
* Array.from, Array.of
* Number.isNaN, Number.toInteger, Number.isInteger, Number.isFinite
* Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors, Object.getPropertyDescriptor,
Object.getPropertyNames, Object.is, Object.isnt
* Math.sign

## IE8 support
There are some shims that do not work in IE8, because it is simply not
possible to implement them properly:

* Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors, Object.getPropertyDescriptor, Object.getPropertyNames
